MSFT
====

This layer is intended to resolve the gap introduced by the pre-provisioned
machines employing the Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011 against the
bootloader built from source code without a proper Microsoft signature.

We keep the faith that everything is built from source codes, so it is
necessary to introduce another template to place the shim binary signed by
Microsoft and override the one built from source code at a moment to align
up the out-of-box requirement. See the section "Out-of-box Experience" in
uefi-secire-boot/README.

If this template is configured, the generated rootfs tarball and RPM will
contain such a pre-signed shim binary rather than the one built from source
code.

Note:
The pre-signed shim binary embeds a WoSign EV certificate as vendor certificate
used to accelerate the progress of Microsoft signing. It is not used to
authenticate grub2 and kernel; This binary also includes a sample shim
certificate used for development and demonstration. Therefore, don't use this
template in your product.
